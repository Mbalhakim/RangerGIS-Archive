# RangerGIS-Archive

Finn van der Ent – “Scientific GIS archive for forest rangers”
In its 125 years of existence, Staatsbosbeheer has collected an immense amount of information about areas that fall under Staatsbosbeheer. The idea is to use AI to make our natural science archive user-friendly accessible for forest rangers. Our forest rangers work a lot with Geoweb to map things. In addition, it is important how data is made available via GIS. Our natural science archive is made accessible via Adlib, which is very outdated. How can AI be applied to make this information in a modern and convenient way?
Jacob Menzinga - “LLM/RAG for training nursing student communication”
Students in health care could practice their communication skills with an AI based chatbot that pretends to be a “patient”. How would this system work in practice? How can you prevent the chatbot from answering in the wrong way (hallucinations)? Is using AI a viable option? What are the requirements of the different stakeholders involved? How about the cost? Privacy? Can a student distinguish between a real patient and a AI in a chat session?
